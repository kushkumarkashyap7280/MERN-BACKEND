# Node.js Core Modules Documentation

This directory contains detailed documentation on essential Node.js core modules for backend development. Each module has its own markdown file with explanations, examples, and best practices.

## Why These Modules Matter

Understanding these core modules is essential for building robust, efficient, and secure Node.js applications. While frameworks like Express.js provide abstractions over some of these modules, knowing how they work under the hood allows you to:

1. **Optimize performance** for specific use cases
2. **Troubleshoot issues** more effectively
3. **Implement custom solutions** when frameworks don't provide what you need
4. **Understand Node.js fundamentals** for better architectural decisions

## How to Use This Documentation

Each module documentation includes:

- Core concepts and functionality
- Common usage patterns
- ES Module syntax examples
- Practical code snippets
- Best practices
- Common pitfalls to avoid

Start with the modules most relevant to your current project needs, but we recommend familiarizing yourself with all of them over time for a comprehensive understanding of Node.js capabilities.
